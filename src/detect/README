detect is an example of how simple hardware probing actually is in Linux! The
concept is simple... pull the vendor and model ID from each card that is
plugged into the systems PCI bus, and then use that to compare to the kernel's
pcimap that correlates the ID's to kernel modules. Then show the needed kernel
modules for each of the installed PCI devices.

The goal of detect is to be a very lightweight simple solution to hardware
probing. The engine itself is detect, and there can be helper scripts/tools
that use detect to build things (like modprobe.conf).

Have fun.
