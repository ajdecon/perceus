This repository is for the latest Perceus release version intended for 
production clusters and HPC systems.

Perceus is a highly scalable cluster provisioning software that is flexible 
enough to enable a diverse range of system deployments in addition to High 
Performance Computing clusters and cloud infrastructure. Perceus can 
effectively deploy and manage systems ranging in size from a few systems to 
many thousands of nodes.

Visit the Perceus homepage at http://perceus.org for more information, 
documentation, and news about the Perceus software project.

The Design of Perceus includes the following points:

      1. System level provisioning with a strong emphasis on stateless
      2. Scalable system management and provisioning model
      3. Simplicity in design
      4. Flexibility both in modules and core functionality
      5. Intuitive for a moderate level administrator
      6. Linux distribution neutral (eventually OS neutral)
