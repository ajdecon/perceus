About Warewulf:

   Warewulf is a solution that grew out of necessity for simple,
   scalable cluster management. What makes Warewulf so revolutionary is
   the ability to retain flexibility while making management of clusters
   simple and scalable.

   Warewulf has become the standard in stateless Node Operating System
   provisioning for clusters.

Moving onto Perceus:

   While Warewulf is a very effective solution for clustering, Perceus
   expands on what Warewulf already accels at and takes it and the next
   logical steps to the next level.

   The Design of Perceus includes the following points:

      1. System level provisioning with a strong emphasis on stateless
      2. Scalable system management and provisioning model
      3. Simplicity in design
      4. Flexibility both in modules and core functionality
      5. Intuitive for a moderate level administrator
      6. Linux distribution neutral (eventually OS neutral)

   Plus all of the features and design considerations which has made
   Warewulf so successful!
