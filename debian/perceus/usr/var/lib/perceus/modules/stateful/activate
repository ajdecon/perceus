Perceus Module for Stateful Provisioning:

Please make sure that provisiond is installed in the VNFS images you would
like to provision statefully, otherwise stateful provisioning would not
work correctly. To re-initialize a node that is currently running, touch
a file in /etc/perceus/modules/stateful/reinit/{vnfs,group,node} corresponding
to the node's VNFS image name, group name or node name.

For example, to re-initialize nodes assigned to the VNFS image "centos5.3.stateful", do:

 # touch /etc/perceus/modules/stateful/reinit/vnfs/centos5.3.stateful

To re-initialize nodes in the group "cluster", do:

 # touch /etc/perceus/modules/stateful/reinit/group/cluster

To re-initialize a node named "node22", do:

 # touch /etc/perceus/modules/stateful/reinit/node/node22
